**OVERALL**
Outline is OK, can have more details.
Make it into a paper
Not super interesting but important and difficult problem
Deep RL and application on a game I have not seen the details visibly yet.
Make sure it really works
**HYPOTHESIS**
Need a hypothesis - set a score to meet (you also highlighted this)
**PROJECT CONTENT**
20-80 Research and Applied
**RELATED WORK**
This portion is your context about this topic. Make sure it covers what has been done recently (a few papers), and what was missing so you had this paper to fill. Final paragraph can be describing your novelty in this paper. In case you want to talk about those concepts, make sure the story flows correctly
**METHOD**
Deep RL - game
**CODE**
In your paper, in appendix probably, place a few lines in order to show how to run. This is for your audience.
**ANALYSIS**
This can be theoretical, peer review or empirical using a model checker or some execution. Make it more interesting with plots, etc. Try to show the utility
**CONCLUSION**
TODO - This section has to be very strong stating what is learned? What is shown and with how much confidence. Take aways.
**REFERENCES**
Sound references from reputable sources such as journal, high citations. Make sure these reference correctly in the manuscript and relevant.
**SUMMARY**
Better story flow needed.
Right now we talk about various things which look like unrelated to the audience.
Have appendix as the instructions how to run
Reminder, If you use Latex make sure you share the TEX file with me too please
Your report should show your hypothesis stated, tested with experiments, and then answered with a particular hypothesis, such as reject the null.
Example null hypothesis - there is no difference between random classification and classification with the method. TODO - Make sure simple to fix things are fixed - your audience will poke holes and critic with minimal effort. It is easier to hide a bad algorithm than hiding an incorrect x-axis label on a plot :-)


CONCLUSION
* Make sure to list all of the takeaways
* KDD conference?

* Hypothesis - set a threshold and repeat the test many times to show statistically
* Do better than random
* Do better than some threshold
